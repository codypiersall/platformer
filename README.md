Platformer
==========

This is a nameless platformer game.  In order to run it, you need:

* [Python3.x] 
* [Pygame]

Most of the sprites used are from other games; I don't own them and I'm not
affiliated with their respective owners' companies, and they don't endorse
it in any way, and all that legal stuff.

The source code for this game is released under the BSD-3 license.
