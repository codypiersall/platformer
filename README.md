Platformer
==========

This is a nameless platformer game.  In order to run it, you need:

* [Python2.7] 
* [Pygame]

Most of the sprites used are from other games; I don't own them and I'm not
affiliated with their respective owners' companies, and they don't endorse
it in any way, and all that legal stuff.
