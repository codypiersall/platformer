Rift
====

This is a platformer game called Rift.  In order to run it, you need:

* [Python] (I don't think it matters whether you use 2 or 3, but it was developed using 3.)
* [Pygame]

Most of the sprites used are from other games; I don't own them and I'm not
affiliated with their respective owners' companies, and they don't endorse
it in any way, and all that legal stuff.

The source code for this game is released under the BSD-3 license.
